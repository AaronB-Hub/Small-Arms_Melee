1. Shine and Up-B broken from EfTsData.dat file (does not crash game)
- Replacing only this file will cause this error, so must be localized or pointer broken somewhere
- this issue goes away when fighting against fox/falco (falco also uses EfFxData.dat)
- location and value of errors independent of player number and can be replicated during different runs/sessions of dolphin


laser
- error on 12th frame (on the 12th frame, in SpecialNLoop at #6, graphic effect [ID 1015] gets loaded)

Shine
- first error on 1st frame advance
- hitbox comes out after 3rd frame advance (on the 1st frame, in SpecialLwStart at #0, graphic effects [ID 1011,1018] get loaded)
- second error on 4th frame advance if no hit, 7th frame advance if hit (same error)
- fox starts coming out of shine on 28th frame advance
- fox returns to neutral stance on ~34th frame advance

Up-B
- first error on 1st frame advance
- second error on 42nd frame advance

Side-B
- error on 24th frame advance
- Fox jumps forward on the 23rd frame advance

2. Being a new character breaks side-B/Kirby model and crashes game (perfect fox clone still crashes)
- this issue goes away when fighting against falco
