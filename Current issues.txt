1. Shine and Up-B broken from EfTsData.dat file (does not crash game)
- Replacing only this file will cause this error, so must be localized or pointer broken somewhere
- this issue goes away when fighting against fox/falco

2. Being a new character breaks side-B/Kirby model and crashes game (perfect fox clone still crashes)
- this issue goes away when fighting against falco
