1. Shine and Up-B broken from EfTsData.dat file (does not crash game)
- Replacing only this file will cause this error, so must be localized or pointer broken somewhere

2. Being a new character breaks side-B and Kirby model and crashes game (perfect fox clone still crashes)

3. Cannot save PlTsAj.dat with modified node name
