Mario with normal article folder and corresponding MEX items
-> normal

Swapping MEX_ITEM_FIREBALL and MEX_ITEM_CAPE values
-> b tries to shoot cape, side-b spawns fireball in hand that never goes away

Swapping the order of the MEX items
-> does nothing (are these just placeholders?)

Setting MEX_ITEM_FIREBALL to 1 or 3 (empty placeholder AND empty item in glitchy article folder)
-> Crashes game on b (JUST like side-b on an mex-cloned spacie)


So, MEX_ITEM_XXX points to character files' item index within glitchy article folder



Making MEX_ITEM_FXLASER different values:
0 - laser
1 - blaster
2 - shadow
3 - item spawn game crash
4 - Light effect with weird spawn locations
5+ - Nothing spawns if there are (dummy) MEX items on the character to reach the index. If not enough items, causes "does not contain item X for fighter y" crash
