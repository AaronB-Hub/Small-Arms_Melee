analysis of the current IASA subroutines for the common moves to see:
- How similar are these across characters?
- Are internal functions re-used across IASA subroutines for different moves?
- Is it worth trying to modify these IASA subroutines themselves (through code injection) rather than undo-ing/modifying a subaction state change right after them?
- etc.
